### Command Line Usage

For advanced users, the system can also be used programmatically:

```python
from file_encryption_system import FileEncryptionSystem

# Initialize the system
encryption_system = FileEncryptionSystem()

# Encrypt a file using hybrid encryption
success, message = encryption_system.encrypt_file_hybrid(
    "input_file.txt",
    "encrypted_file.bin",
    encryption_system.public_key,
    "your_password"
)

# Decrypt a file
success, message = encryption_system.decrypt_file_hybrid(
    "encrypted_file.bin",
    "decrypted_file.txt",
    encryption_system.private_key,
    "your_password"
)
```

## Performance Testing

## Performance Benchmarks

Based on testing with various file sizes:

| File Size | AES Encryption | AES Decryption | Hybrid Encryption | Hybrid Decryption |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 1 MB      | ~50 MB/s       | ~45 MB/s       | ~40 MB/s          | ~35 MB/s          |
| 10 MB     | ~45 MB/s       | ~40 MB/s       | ~35 MB/s          | ~30 MB/s          |
| 50 MB     | ~40 MB/s       | ~35 MB/s       | ~30 MB/s          | ~25 MB/s          |

   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade cryptography
   pip install --upgrade pycryptodome
   ```

2. **Permission Errors**
   - Run as administrator if needed
   - Check file permissions
   - Ensure write access to output directory

3. **Memory Issues**
   - Close other applications
   - Use smaller file sizes for testing
   - Increase system virtual memory

### Error Messages
